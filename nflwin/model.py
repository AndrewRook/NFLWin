    """The object that computes win probabilities.

    In addition to holding the model itself, it defines some columns names likely to be
    used in the model as parameters to allow other users to more easily figure out which
    columns go into the model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    copy_data : boolean (default=``True``)
        Whether or not to copy data when fitting and applying the model. Running the model
        in-place (``copy_data=False``) will be faster and have a smaller memory footprint,
        but if not done carefully can lead to data integrity issues.

    Attributes
    ----------
    model : A Scikit-learn pipeline (or equivalent)
        The actual model used to compute WP. Upon initialization it will be set to
        a default model, but can be overridden by the user.
    column_descriptions : dictionary
        A dictionary whose keys are the names of the columns used in the model, and the values are
        string descriptions of what the columns mean. Set at initialization to be the default model,
        if you create your own model you'll need to update this attribute manually.
    training_seasons : A list of ints, or ``None`` (default=``None``)
        If the model was trained using data downloaded from nfldb, a list of the seasons
        used to train the model. If nfldb was **not** used, an empty list. If no model
        has been trained yet, ``None``.
    training_season_types : A list of strings or ``None`` (default=``None``)
        Same as ``training_seasons``, except for the portions of the seasons used in training the
        model ("Preseason", "Regular", and/or "Postseason").
    validation_seasons : same as ``training_seasons``, but for validation data.
    validation_season_types : same as ``training_season_types``, but for validation data.
    sample_probabilities : A numpy array of floats or ``None`` (default=``None``)
        After the model has been validated, contains the sampled predicted probabilities used to
        compute the validation statistic.
    predicted_win_percents : A numpy array of floats or ``None`` (default=``None``)
        After the model has been validated, contains the actual probabilities in the test
        set at each probability in ``sample_probabilities``.
    num_plays_used : A numpy array of floats or ``None`` (default=``None``)
        After the model has been validated, contains the number of plays used to compute each
        element of ``predicted_win_percents``.
    model_directory : string
        The directory where all models will be saved to or loaded from.

        Once a modeling pipeline is set up (either the default or something
        custom-generated), historical data needs to be fed into it in order to
        "fit" the model so that it can then be used to predict future results.
        This method implements a simple wrapper around the core Scikit-learn functionality
        which does this.

        The default is to use data from the nfldb database, however that can be changed
        to a simple Pandas DataFrame if desired (for instance if you wish to use data
        from another source).

        There is no particular output from this function, rather the parameters governing
        the fit of the model are saved inside the model object itself. If you want to get an
        estimate of the quality of the fit, use the ``validate_model`` method after running
        this method.

        Notes
        -----
        If you are loading in the default model, **there is no need to re-run this method**.
        In fact, doing so will likely result in weird errors and could corrupt the model if you
        were to try to save it back to disk.

        Parameters
        ----------
        source_data : the string ``"nfldb"`` or a Pandas DataFrame (default=``"nfldb"``)
            The data to be used to train the model. If ``"nfldb"``, will query the nfldb
            database for the training data (note that this requires a correctly configured
            installation of nfldb's database).
        training_seasons : list of ints (default=``[2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014]``)
            What seasons to use to train the model if getting data from the nfldb database.
            If ``source_data`` is not ``"nfldb"``, this argument will be ignored.
            **NOTE:** it is critical not to use all possible data in order to train the
            model - some will need to be reserved for a final validation (see the
            ``validate_model`` method). A good dataset to reserve
            for validation is the most recent one or two NFL seasons.
        training_season_types : list of strings (default=``["Regular", "Postseason"]``)
            If querying from the nfldb database, what parts of the seasons to use.
            Options are "Preseason", "Regular", and "Postseason". If ``source_data`` is not

        target_colname : string or integer (default=``"offense_won"``)

        Once a modeling pipeline is trained, a different dataset must be fed into the trained model
        to validate the quality of the fit.
        This method implements a simple wrapper around the core Scikit-learn functionality
        which does this.

        The default is to use data from the nfldb database, however that can be changed
        to a simple Pandas DataFrame if desired (for instance if you wish to use data
        from another source).

        The output of this method is a p value which represents the confidence at which
        we can reject the null hypothesis that the model predicts the appropriate win
        probabilities. This number is computed by first smoothing the predicted win probabilities of both all test data and
        just the data where the offense won with a gaussian `kernel density
        estimate <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KernelDensity.html#sklearn.neighbors.KernelDensity>`_
        with standard deviation = 0.01. Once the data is smooth, ratios at each percentage point from 1% to 99% are computed (i.e.
        what fraction of the time did the offense win when the model says they have a 1% chance of winning, 2% chance, etc.). Each of
        these ratios should be well approximated by the binomial distribution, since they are essentially independent (not perfectly
        but hopefully close enough) weighted coin flips, giving a p value. From there `Fisher's method <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_method>`_
        is used to combine the p values into a global p value. A p value close to zero means that the model is unlikely to be
        properly predicting the correct win probabilities. A p value close to one, **while not proof that the model is correct**,
        means that the model is at least not inconsistent with the hypothesis that it predicts good win probabilities.

        Parameters
        ----------
        source_data : the string ``"nfldb"`` or a Pandas DataFrame (default=``"nfldb"``)
            The data to be used to train the model. If ``"nfldb"``, will query the nfldb
            database for the training data (note that this requires a correctly configured
            installation of nfldb's database).
        training_seasons : list of ints (default=``[2015]``)
            What seasons to use to validate the model if getting data from the nfldb database.
            If ``source_data`` is not ``"nfldb"``, this argument will be ignored.
            **NOTE:** it is critical not to use the same data to validate the model as was used
            in the fit. Generally a good data set to use for validation is one from a time
            period more recent than was used to train the model. For instance, if the model was trained
            on data from 2009-2014, data from the 2015 season would be a sensible choice to validate the model.
        training_season_types : list of strings (default=``["Regular", "Postseason"]``)
            If querying from the nfldb database, what parts of the seasons to use.
            Options are "Preseason", "Regular", and "Postseason". If ``source_data`` is not
            ``"nfldb"``, this argument will be ignored.
        target_colname : string or integer (default=``"offense_won"``)
            The name of the target variable column. 

        Returns
        -------
        float, between 0 and 1
            The combined p value, where smaller values indicate that the model is not accurately predicting win
            probabilities.
            
        Raises
        ------
        NotFittedError
            If the model hasn't been fit.

        Notes
        -----
        Probabilities are computed between 1 and 99 percent because a single incorrect prediction at 100% or 0% automatically drives
        the global p value to zero. Since the model is being smoothed this situation can occur even when there are no model predictions
        at those extreme values, and therefore leads to erroneous p values.

        While it seems reasonable (to me at least), I am not totally certain that this approach is entirely correct.
        It's certainly sub-optimal in that you would ideally reject the null hypothesis that the model predictions
        **aren't** appropriate, but that seems to be a much harder problem (and one that would need much more test
        data to beat down the uncertainties involved). I'm also not sure if using Fisher's method is appropriate here,
        and I wonder if it might be necessary to Monte Carlo this. I would welcome input from others on better ways to do this.
