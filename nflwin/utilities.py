    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    Returns
    -------
    SQLAlchemy engine object
        A connected engine, ready to be used to query the DB.

    Raises
    ------

    """Get play-by-play data from the nfldb database.

    We use a specialized query and then postprocessing because, while possible to
    do using the objects created by ``nfldb``, it is *orders of magnitude slower*.
    This is due to the more general nature of ``nfldb``, which is not really designed
    for this kind of data mining. Since we need to get a lot of data in a single way,
    it's much simpler to interact at a lower level with the underlying postgres
    database.


    Parameters
    ----------
    season_years : list (default=None)
        A list of all years to get data for (earliest year in nfldb is 2009).
        If ``None``, get data from all available seasons.
    season_types : list (default=["Regular", "Postseason"])
        A list of all parts of seasons to get data for (acceptable values are
        "Preseason", "Regular", and "Postseason"). If ``None``, get data from
        all three season types.

    Returns
    -------
    Pandas DataFrame
        The play by play data, with the following columns:
        
        * **gsis_id:** The official NFL GSIS_ID for the game.
        * **drive_id:** The id of the drive, starts at 1 and increases by 1 for each new drive.
        * **play_id:** The id of the play in ``nfldb``. Note that sequential plays have
          increasing but not necessarily sequential values. With ``drive_id`` and ``gsis_id``,
          works as a unique identifier for a given play.
        * **quarter:** The quarter, prepended with "Q" (e.g. ``Q1`` means the first quarter). 
          Overtime periods are denoted as ``OT``, ``OT2``, and theoretically ``OT3`` if one were to
          ever be played.
        * **seconds_elapsed:** seconds elapsed since the start of the quarter.
        * **offense_team:** The abbreviation of the team currently with possession of the ball.
        * **yardline:** The current field position. Goes from -49 to 49, where negative numbers
          indicate that the team with possession is on its own side of the field.
        * **down:** The down. kickoffs, extra points, and similar have a down of 0.
        * **yards_to_go:** How many yards needed in order to get a first down (or touchdown).
        * **home_team:** The abbreviation of the home team.
        * **away_team:** The abbreviation of the away team.
        * **curr_home_score:** The home team's score at the start of the play.
        * **curr_away_score:** The away team's score at the start of the play. 
        * **offense_won:** A boolean - ``True`` if the offense won the game, ``False`` otherwise. (The
          database query skips tied games.)

    Notes
    -----
    ``gsis_id``, ``drive_id``, and ``play_id`` are not necessary to make the model, but
    are included because they can be useful for computing things like WPA.
