Installation
===============
Stable releases of NFLWin are available on pip::

  $ pip install nflwin

The default install provides exactly the tools necessary to make
predictions using the standard WP model as well as make new
models. However it does not include the dependencies necessary for
using :ref:`nfldb`, produce diagnostic plots, or contribute to the
package.
